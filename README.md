# Protractor

A Basic protractor project with Jasmine and few GUI tests.

I basically use this project for answering question in stackoverflow.

Clone the repo and run `npm i` or `npm install` to pull all dependencies in package.json from npmjs.com

And also run webdriver-manager update once to update webdrivers for chrome and Firefox.

If the directConnect is to true in protractor config file tests should run on running `npm run test`.
